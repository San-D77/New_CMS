        "body": "<strong>Brittany Dudchenko<\/strong> is the wife of the American football quarterback <strong>Drew Brees<\/strong>. The couple has been together for over two decades. Brittany is also a proud mother of four kids with her husband. Do you know Brittany and Drew have been together since high school?\n\nTalking about her husband, Drew is an ex-football quarterback who spent a significant portion of his prolific football career, playing for the team New Orleans Saints. Unlike his huge popularity in the media, his wife Brittany has remained a little bit secretive about her life.\n\nDudchenko is passionate about humanitarian works. She along with her husband run a charity Organization named The Brees Dream Foundation which helps cancer people.\u00a0In today's topic, we will discuss all the related questions about Brittany, her early life, kids, and many more.\n<h2>Who is Brittany Dudchenko? Insights on The Life of Drew Brees' Wife<\/h2>\nBrittany was born on 15th January 1979 in Syracuse, Cleveland, Ohio to parents Pete Dudchenko and Kathie Dudchenko. Her parents' details have been a big mystery, so no more information related to Brittany's parents is available.\n\nAs of 2022, the celebrity spouse is 41 years old. She holds Capricorn as a zodiac sign and is American by her nationality. Her full name is Brittany Middleton Dudchenko.\n\nTalking about her education, Dudchenko did her high school at Wawasee High School situated in Syracuse, Indiana in 1999. She later earned her master's degree in Industrial Management from Purdue University, in West Lafayette, Indiana.\n<h2>When did Brittany Meet Her Hubby Drew?<\/h2>\nThe couple first met in 1999 at college. At that time, Brittany was Drew's junior. Drew was a sophomore in college. But they wouldn't begin dating instantly.\n\nIt was his 20th birthday Drew thought to invite his college mates including his then-dream-wife Brittany. While his birthday party was going on, the footballer already had 17 shots and then decided to approach Brittany. The conversation was casual and Drew only talked about football.\n\nAccording to him,\n<blockquote>\" I made fool of myself when I first met her\"<\/blockquote>\nAlthough the NFL player's first effort was ruined, Drew already thought, \"I'm gonna marry this woman.\" For the second time, the two met again six months after when their college invited all of them to the party and Brees knew that his now spouse would also be there. He said,\n<blockquote>\"I finagled my way to get invited to a party that I knew she'd be at.\"<\/blockquote>\nAfter they met at the party, Drew asked Brittany for a date. But the fact is that the date wasn't exactly only for 2 because her friends were also with her to see the guy who had made a bad impression on Brittany on their first meeting. Same as Dudchenko, Drew also invited his colleagues to join them.\n\nIn an interview with CBS NEWS, Drew opened up that her presence and aura mostly attracted him. But, at the same time, Brittany said it was rather her stature. She added,\n<blockquote>I think it was more breeding stock (LAUGHS). He wanted me tall.<\/blockquote>\nLater on, the lovers got engaged to be married.\n<h2>Brittany Dudchenko Is Married to Her Husband <strong>Drew Christopher Brees For Nearly Two Decades<\/strong><\/h2>\nAfter dating for a long time, they thought of getting married. And on 8th February 2003, the couple exchanged their vows at Coronado, California in the presence of their family and close friends.\n\nOn their 16th anniversary, the NFL player Drew posted a wedding photo of them expressing his love,\n<blockquote>16 years ago today I marry this beautiful woman. I thak God for her everyay!<\/blockquote>\n[caption id=\"attachment_2074\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2074 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Brittany-and-her-husband.PNG.jpg\" alt=\"Brittany and her spouse Drew\" width=\"450\" height=\"428\" \/> Brittany Dudchenko and her partner Drew at their Wedding[\/caption]\n\nIt's been nearly two decades since they got hitched and their married life is going on a good path. Furthermore, her spouse Brittany has also posted a number of photos of his wife and kids on his social media handles. Back in Feb 2022, Drew uploaded a picture collection of the lovers on his official Instagram on their 19th anniversary. He captioned the image,\n<blockquote>To the love of my life on our anniveresary.....I love this journey with you. Our best is yet to come.<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Brittany Shares Four Children With Drew<\/h3>\nThe long-time couple has four children three sons and one daughter named Baylen Roberts Brees, Bowen Cristopher Brees, Callen Christian Brees, and the youngest is a girl Rylen Judith Brees.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2082\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2082 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Brittany-with-her-children.jpg\" alt=\"Brittany with her spouse and 4 childrens\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" \/> Brittany shares 4 adorable kids with her husband Drew[\/caption]\n\nTheir first child a son Baylen was born on 15 January 2009.

And the lovers established it in 2003 and the non-profit organization is running till now.\n\nIn fact, the reason behind the establishment of the organization was Brittany's aunt, who died of cancer. Similarly, the charity has helped plenty of medical field and needy children. Similarly, during the pandemic of COVID-19, the couple also donated $5 million to Louisiana.\n\nFurthermore, in 2005, the former NFL player and his wife lend a hand to the people who were suffering from the damage after the Hurricane in New Orleans.\n\nThe couple has also worked along with a couple of NGO organizations to build parks, hospitals, and educational institutions.\n<h2>Net Worth Of Brittany Dudchenko<\/h2>\nThe estimated net worth of Brittany is about $500,000 in 2022.

So, let's find out who is Jahan dating in 2022. Has Yousaf ever linked with Casey Deidrick?\r\n\r\nHere is everything you are looking for her life including her love for tattoos, parents, siblings, and many other interesting facts!\r\n<h2>Jahan Yousaf's Parents And Siblings<\/h2>\r\nJahan was born on 27th August 1989 in Northbrook, Illinois. As of 2022, she is 31 years old. Yousaf is the daughter of Sohail Yousaf and Neda. She holds the zodiac sign of Virgo and has dual nationality that is American and Pakistani.\r\n\r\nAs for her ethnicity, Jahan has a mixed ethnical background as her mother Neda has Polish\/German\/Lithuanian descent. As per the sources, her father moved to the US from Pakistan for a better future. He currently works as a realtor in California.\r\n\r\nJahan spent her childhood in Chicago, Illinois alongside her parents and sisters, Aisha and Yasmine. It seems like she has good bonding with her both of her sisters.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1999\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1999 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Yousaf-sisters-.jpg\" alt=\"Jahan Yousaf with her 2 sisters\" width=\"450\" height=\"424\" \/> Jahan with her sisters Aisha and Yasmine[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTalking about her educational life, Jahan who is fond of music completed her schooling at Glenbrook North High School, Northbrook.\r\n<h2>Career Details: Jahan Runs The Band \"Krewella\" Along With Her Sister Yasmine<\/h2>\r\nAs already said before, Yousaf is now a core member of the band Krewella. She works as a producer and DJ for the band. Talking more about the musical band, it is an electronic dance music band from the Chicago suburb of Northbrook, Illinois. The band was formed in 2007 along with the Yousaf sisters and one other member Kris Trindl. The music style of Krewella is mostly known as EDM, dance rock, hardstyle, and dance-pop.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2000\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2000 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/krewella-members.jpg\" alt=\"Krewella three members when it was formed\" width=\"450\" height=\"426\" \/> Jahan with the 2 Krewella members Yasmine Yousaf and Kris Trindl[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe trio was actually created by Jahan during her school life with her sister Yasmine and Kris Trindl, where all of them were studying at the same school Glenbrook North High School.\r\n\r\nAt first, everything was going well and the trio was getting huge success. They received plenty of contracts and also released a number of songs. But, things did not work well and the trio later split out in 2104. After the band dissolved, Kris left group.\r\n<h3>Kris Trindl Filed An $5 Million Lawsuit Against Yousaf Sisters<\/h3>\r\nAs we said earlier that Trindl sued the Yousaf sisters for $5 million after he was allegedly kicked out of the group without his own will. He said while the band was still at the height of its success took a short break from his musical career to recover from his alcohol addiction.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Kris went to rehab to get over it and fully recovered, so that, he could rejoin the band. Following his recovery, he was back and rejoined the band.\r\n\r\nBut, Kris already quit drinking and stopped partying. First of all, the Yousaf sisters also did not like Kris rejoining the band and they couldn't accept the truth that Kris wouldn't party anymore. Further, they thought that Kris was still in depression and the sisters started to take benefit of it. They eventually denied Kris's membership in the group.\r\n\r\nAs per Kris, since the two sisters started to ignore Kris and did not want him to be in the group, he filed a lawsuit for $5 million against the two members of Krewella, Yasmine and Jahan.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, the Yousaf sisters claimed that Kris left the group by his own intention.\r\n<h3>Was Jahan Yousaf and Kris Trindl Ever In a Romantic Relationship?<\/h3>\r\nDespite the fact that Kris left the group, Kris and Jahan were in a romantic relationship while in high school. They both were pretty interested in the music and thought of making the band. The ex-couple later included Jahan's sister Yasmine too.\r\n\r\nWhen the band got formed, they were still dating. However, the reports of their split never came out to the media.\r\n<h2>Did Jahan Actually Get Success Through The Band Krewella?<\/h2>\r\nThe answer is yes. She actually rose to fame through the band \"Krewella.\" At first, Kris was the producer of the band, so Jahan and her sister released a lot of songs.\r\n\r\nBut when the band Krewella signed to be a partner of the EDM youtube channel, they got a contract to sign with Monstercat music label. After the contract, in December 2011, the band released its first song<em> Killing It<\/em>. And it later promoted through social media and the EDM Youtube channel.\r\n\r\nThey later came up with their first album <em>Get Wet<\/em>, which also listed on US Billboards within a few days.\r\n<h3>Awards Of Jahan Yousaf<\/h3>\r\nAs Jahan has a huge fan following, she is loved and praised by everyone. She has done many live concerts too. As a result, she won the International Dance Music Award for Best Breakthrough Artist on 2012.\r\n<h2>Is Jahan Yousaf Really Dating Casey Deidrick?<\/h2>\r\nMany sources say Jahan once dated an American actor Casey Deidrick. They reportedly started dating in 2013. On September 27, 2013, Jahan even posted a picture of them with the caption \u201cthe tree and the troll. \ud83c\udf32\ud83d\udc79 <a class=\"oajrlxb2 g5ia77u1 qu0x051f esr5mh6w e9989ue4 r7d6kgcz rq0escxv nhd2j8a9 nc684nl6 p7hjln8o kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x jb3vyjys rz4wbd8a qt6c0cv9 a8nywdso i1ao9s8h esuyzwwr f1sip0of lzcic4wl notranslate _a6hd\" role=\"link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/caseydeidrick\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@caseydeidrick<\/a>.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2001\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2001 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Jahan-and-her-Boyfriend.jpg\" alt=\"Jahan with her Actor boyfriend\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" \/> Jahan and her boyfriend Casey Deidrick[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThough, as of 2022, there is no recent update on whether the couple is still dating or not, some sources claim that the two are still items.\r\n<h3>Who is Her Boyfriend Casey Deidrick?<\/h3>\r\nHer reported beau Deidrick is an American actor and singer. He is best known for appearing in the role of Chad Dimera on the NBC soap opera <em>Days of our Lives<\/em>.\r\n\r\nHe was born on April 25, 1987. As of 2022, the actor is 35 years old. He was born to the parents Jon Deidrick, who works as an IBEW 332 Union electrician, and mother Denise Deck, who is a nurse.\r\n<h2>Tattoo Lover Jahan Yousaf<\/h2>\r\nJahan is a tattoos freak. She has at least 10 known tattoos like the number 6-8-10 on her neck. Similarly, she has inked a mandala on her forearm, a rose on her neck, a tattoo of Kurt Kobain on her right forearm, and many more.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_2002\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"wp-image-2002 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/Jahans-tattoos.jpg\" alt=\"Jahan's tattos hold a different meaning\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" \/> Tattoos freak Jahan Yousaf[\/caption]\r\n<h3>Jahan Inked the Tat 6-8-10 with Two Other Members of Krewella<\/h3>\r\nTalking about the story behind the tattoo, it all happened while the ex-trio Jahan, Yasmine, and Kris decided to drop school and wanted to form a music band of their own. The trio dropped out of school on 8th June 2010, so to make the day memorable they all decided to ink that date as 6-8-10. Both sisters Jahan and Yasmine inked the number on their neck, whereas Krish inked on his arm.\r\n\r\nJahan once explained why she inked a tattoo on her neck,\r\n<blockquote>\"I love neck tattoos, I\u2019ve always loved it. For some reason everytime I get a tattoo, I like putting tattoos in dangerous places, because I love the idea of not regretting anything. And in twenty years I might have a really gross wrinkly neck, but whatever, you live with your mistakes.\"<\/blockquote>\r\nAs already mentioned before she also has a rose tattoo on her neck which also holds a short story,\r\n<blockquote>\"On the roses: \u201cI love the idea of every rose has a thorn, everything that\u2019s beautiful has something ugly with it, too. It also represents how I feel about success, you have to suffer in order to succeed. You have to try and fail, and try to win, and you have to sink to swim, that whole idea. I have a tattered rose where the petals of the rose kind of have holes in them. I love the idea of things that are beautiful in nature that have flaws in them too.\"<\/blockquote>\r\n<h2>How Much Does Jahan Earn?<\/h2>\r\nYousaf has earned quite a decent amount of fortune from her musical career. And, as of 2022, her net worth is $1 million.\r\n<h3>Her Social Media Handel<\/h3>\r\nJahan is pretty active on every social media handle. Among all the social media, Jahan is highly active on Instagram, where she posts about her daily life.",

In fact, there were quite a lot of legal dramas in his family because his dad was truly a criminal type. Let's find out are Andrew's father and mother still married? Did you know Andrew\u2019s dad once shoot his mother in her head?\r\n\r\nWell, here are all the answers to your questions. In the article below, we will talk about his siblings, net worth, and more!\r\n<h2>Andrew Shingange Full Bio: His Early Details and Ethnicity<\/h2>\r\nAndrew was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. While his exact date of birth is yet to be revealed, Shingange was born in the 1980s. At that time, Africa was under Apartheid rule, a rule of White people upon Black people.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1597\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1597 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Andrew-Shingange-2.jpg\" alt=\"where is Andrew Shingange now?\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" \/> Andrew is the half-brother of comedian Trevor Noah.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTalking about his nationality, the celebrity sibling is an African and has a mixed ethnical background. His mother Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah who is Xhosa belongs to Nguni ethnic group.\r\n<h3>Andrew Shingange's Father Was Abusive: His Mother's Previous Interracial Marriage<\/h3>\r\nAndrew is the son of Ngisaveni Abel Shingange (father) and Patricia Nombuyiselo (mother). Patricia was previously married to her ex-spouse Robert Noah who was of Swiss-German ancestry. In fact, Robert\u2019s relationship with Andrew\u2019s mother Patricia was illegal as no other race was allowed to have intimate relations. As a result, they had to face a lot of criticism and harassment every day. At the time, the family was often attacked by fellow Africans.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, his mother Patricia went on to marry her second husband Ngisaveni. However, Abel was an abusive man and was involved in domestic violence. The old man even abused Andrew and his brother mentally and physically.\r\n\r\nEventually, the abuse was too much for the family, and Patricia decided to start a new life with her children. So, Andrew's dad and mom legally separated in 1996. Following their divorce, Nombuyiselo got married to Sfiso Khoza. <strong>\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n<h2><strong>Andrew Shingange\u2019s Mother Patricia was Shot In The Head By His Father<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nPatricia, after marrying Sfiso was living her life in peace. Nevertheless, one day in the early morning, when Patricia and Andrew were returning from church, they came across a drunk man who was actually Andrew's dad Abel. As soon as they saw each other, Abel said that Patricia ruined his life. While both parties were in an argument, Abel pulled out a gun and came toward his ex-wife and tried to shoot her but his gun couldn't trigger as it was jammed.\r\n\r\nFollowing the attempt, Patricia pushed her ex-spouse and ran toward her car. But, Abel again followed Patricia and shot her and the bullet went through her head and neck and embedded in her shoulder. She was immediately <a href=\"https:\/\/min.news\/en\/world\/56ec00aed17cbd0ae538b550965a355c.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">taken to the hospital in the United Kingdom<\/a> by her son Andrew.\r\n\r\nAfter that, Abel was charged with an attempt to murder and went to jail. But, after 3 years, Abel was released on bail.\r\n<h3>His Education<\/h3>\r\nHe attended Sandringham High School and then went on to enroll at Damelin Eden High School Randburg, followed by Sandringham High School.\r\n<h2><strong>Andrew Shingange\u2019s Siblings <\/strong><\/h2>\r\nHe has a biological sibling named Isaac Shingange. In addition, Andrew also has a half-brother named Trevor Noah from his mother's relationship with his ex-husband Robert Noah. Trevor Noah is one of the top comedians and well-known artists all over the world.\r\n<h3><strong>Shingange\u2019s Half-Brother Trevor Noah<\/strong><\/h3>\r\nTrevor was born on 20<sup>th<\/sup> February 1984, in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Source: Daily Mail[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dino and Shayanna have been dating since 2017. The couple first met in Rhode Island through a mutual friend. Jenkins had moved to Rhode Island in 2017 after the demise of her ex-fiancee, Aaron Hernandez (a late American Football player at New England Patriots). <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her late fiancee Hernandez was a convicted murderer who killed semi-professional football player <strong>Odin Lloyd<\/strong> and later died by suicide inside the prison in April 2017. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demise of the ex-fiancee left Jenkins shattered.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> However, Jenkins' shift to Rhode Island brought Dino into her life. Eventually, after their first meeting, Guilmette and Jenkins started seeing each other and began dating.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the meantime, there are a lot of rumors that Dino and Shayanna have tied the knot, however, both of them remain mum about the situation.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>How many children does Dino Guilmette have?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Altogether, Dino has three children named <strong>Mia Guilmette<\/strong>, <strong>Giselle Guilmette<\/strong>, and <strong>Arielle Janelle<\/strong> <strong>Hernandez<\/strong>.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He shares Mia with his ex-girlfriend whose name is unknown.

If we go through their social media account, we can hardly see their photos together.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nevertheless, both Dino and Shayana are open to sharing their beautiful family moments on social media. But, lately, they have rarely come up in front of the media, due to which people are assuming their separation.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there is no confirmation regarding their separation. Seeing their shared family moments on their respective Insta, we can certainly say that both of them are prioritizing their children well being above anything else.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Dino\u2019s connection with Shayana\u2019s former boyfriend late Aaron Hernandez<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">efore his meeting with Shayana, he already had a connection with Shayana\u2019s former boyfriend Aaron Hernandez.

Similar to Dino's interest in football, he also did boxing for a while, but that too didn't turn out good for him.\r\n<h2><b>Dino once tried his hands in Modeling\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between 2002 and 2003, Dino tried to pursue his career in modeling.

Meanwhile, in both the years 2005 and 2014, he filed for bankruptcy in Rhode Island.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all his troubles with the law, Dino, who came into the limelight as Shayanna\u2019s boyfriend, persevered through it all and now is a successful entrepreneur.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Dino Guilmette\u2019s Net Worth<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of 2022, Dino Guilmette\u2019s net worth is estimated at $2 Million.\u00a0 He earned the major source of his income through his work as an entrepreneur.<\/span>",

Like her mother, she works in the film industry, but not as an actress. Currently, she is learning about sound and music under the guidance of brilliant musical geniuses.\r\n\r\nThe year 2021 was tragic for Raine as she lost her mother Tawny Kitaen at the age of 59. 5 months after her demise, Raine was all over the internet and media when she revealed the actual cause of her mother's death.\r\n\r\nSo how is the life of Raine Finley at present? Is she dating anyone? We have plenty to share such as her early life, education, net worth, etc.\r\n<h2>Raine Finley Family Background<\/h2>\r\nRaine was born on <em>1st June 1998<\/em> in Newport Beach City in California, US State, to a wealthy family. Her father Chuck Finely was a fine baseball player and her mother Tawny Kitaen was a popular Hollywood actress.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1135\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1135\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Raine-Finley-back-in-2010..jpg\" alt=\"Raine Finley looking funny and adorable.\" width=\"450\" height=\"601\" \/> A younger version of Raine Finley.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nShe has an elder sister Wynter Merin Finley born on <em>18th March 1993<\/em>.\u00a0 In 2002, her parents got divorced, and since then, Raine and Wynter had been living with her mother until her demise in 2021.\r\n\r\nHer mother Tawny <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marca.com\/en\/lifestyle\/us-news\/2021\/10\/22\/6171df54268e3e5a538b45cb.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">died at the age of 59<\/a> due to dilated cardiomyopathy, a common heart disease.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1132\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1132\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Raine-Finley-with-her-family..jpg\" alt=\"Raine Finley enjoying family time.\" width=\"450\" height=\"585\" \/> Raine Finley in a get-together with her family.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nBesides, Raine belongs to the white ethnic race and follows the Christian religion. She was brought up in New Port. Her parents Chuck and Tawny divorced in 2002 after which Tawny got both custody of her daughter.\r\n<h2>Raine Finley Education<\/h2>\r\nMaybe it was the influence of her father, Raine had a great amount of enthusiasm toward sports since childhood. At the age of 6, while studying at Corona del Mar High School, she used to play softball.\r\n\r\nShe even was the recipient of the \"Athlete of the Week\" award for her match-winning performance in Junior High School. Afterward, at the age of 12, she played soccer full time and added the MVP Defensive Award for Junior Varsity to her accolades.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1136\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1136\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Raine-Finley-has-always-been-a-sports-fan..jpg\" alt=\"Raine Finley loves to play softball.\" width=\"450\" height=\"239\" \/> Raine Finley was photographed before a softball game.[\/caption]\r\n<h2>Raine Finley Career<\/h2>\r\nFor the longest time, Raine wanted to get involved in social work and collaborated with Children\u2019s Hospital and the Boys and Girls\u2019 Club as their partner fundraiser and began her community service from 2013 until 2017. Then, in 2017, she enrolled in \u201cThe Art Institute of California-San Francisco\u201d to make her career in Music Composition for Digital Media.\r\n\r\nWith a motive to have some side income along with experience, Raine worked as an intern at 92.9 Kjee Radio Station for 4 months. After finishing her internship, she even worked as a waitress at Delores Park Cafe in San Francisco for 8 months.\r\n\r\nIn May 2019, her career began to shape up. She got an opportunity to join as an intern at Warner Bros. Entertainment and has been working there since. At the workplace, she is learning music composition under the supervision of experts like Mike Marchain and other companions. Additionally, Raine is acquiring lessons on ADR mixers, music supervision, and sound designing.\r\n<h2>Is Raine Finley Dating Anybody?<\/h2>\r\nBack in 2018, she shared a photo with a guy named <strong>Jack Garell<\/strong>. Though she didn't reveal if he was her boyfriend or not, the coziness in their picture said everything.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1133\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1133\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Raine-Finley-may-be-in-relationship..jpg\" alt=\"Raine Finley and her suspected boyfriend in black glasses.\" width=\"450\" height=\"286\" \/> Raine Finley with her rumored boyfriend.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, she has kept her personal life private and there is not enough proof to justify her relationship status, her love is still a secret that awaits to be unfolded.\r\n\r\nWe first came to know about her relationship through her Facebook account in which she shared a handful of photos with the guy.\r\n<h2>More on Raine Finley's Mother Tawny Kitaen<\/h2>\r\nTawny Kitaen worked in the Hollywood industry throughout her life. She kickstarted her career as a Television actress with her appearance in the films like <em>Malibu<\/em> and <em>California Girls<\/em> and also starred in a few comedy as well as horror roles.\r\n\r\nHowever, she rose into the limelight after her appearance in heavy metal music videos that included \u00a0Ratt's \"Back for More\" (1984) and Whitesnake's \"Still of the Night\", \"Is This Love\" and \"Here I Go Again\" (all 1987).\r\n<h3>Tawny Kitaen Had a Series of Relationships<\/h3>\r\nRaine's mother Tawny was a hot sensation during her time. She certainly had raised many eyebrows and set many hearts on fire through her beauty. Likewise, Tawny was in relationships with a number of men.\r\n\r\nTawny dated Ratt guitarist <strong>Robbin Crosby<\/strong> during and after high school. She also had a 1-year affair with <strong>O.J. Simpson<\/strong>., who at the time was married. In 1996, Tawny married famous singer <strong>David Coverdale<\/strong> in 1989, but unfortunately, the couple later divorced in 1991.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1141\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-1141\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Tawny-Kitaen-with-her-first-husband..jpg\" alt=\"Tawny and David divorced in 1991.\" width=\"450\" height=\"350\" \/> Tawny Kitaen with her first husband David Coverdale.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nRaine Finley's father Chuck Finley was Tawny's second husband.

The pair separated in 2002.\r\n<h3>Controversies Always Surrounded Tawny Kitaen<\/h3>\r\nIn 2002, Tawny was charged with domestic violence against her husband Finley which resulted in their divorce. Afterward, in 2006, prosecutors convicted Tawny of 15 grams of cocaine possession at her home in Orange County for which she went under 6 months of rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nShe was arrested twice, first in 2009, and then in 2019 for driving under the influence\u00a0in\u00a0Newport Beach, California.\r\n<h2>Raine Finley Net Worth<\/h2>\r\nRaine Finley is currently working as an intern and her full-scale earning hasn't started yet. We can say that she is in the midway of her career where she is learning things in order to have a proper amount of income of her own in the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, money isn't an issue for her as she comes from a wealthy background. Her celebrity mother Tawny Kitaen has earned more than enough.\r\n\r\nAfter Tawny Kitaen's sad demise, all her properties and assets legally belong to her daughters Raine and Wynter. According to some sources, Raine Finley's present net worth is around $10,000 USD.\r\n<h2>Raine Finley's Social Media Presence<\/h2>\r\nRaine has an Instagram account that goes by the username \"rainedayss.\" Currently, her Instagram has 830 followers to be exact. She has set her account in private mode, hence, we had no way to peek into it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Raine Finley also has a Facebook account with over 1K friends. However, she is inactive on Facebook as her last post dates back to 2020.",

        "body": "<strong>Emily's Ears<\/strong> is a social media star with impaired hearing. She has gained several fans on her Instagram and other social media handles through her entertaining videos.\r\n\r\nInitially, Emily was a member of the Adrian and Emily web group along with her ex-boyfriend which also helped her get fame to some extent. Later, she created her own YouTube channel and started uploading videos there. She is active on almost all social media platforms with a good fan following.\r\n\r\nDespite having hearing issues, Emily has made her own identity in the entertainment field. Looking at her work, nobody can say she has difficulty in hearing. Emily along with her family members has an ally Loudegange where we can see the collective effort of all the family members. In fact, all the members of the family are social media influencers.\r\n\r\nHere, let's know what Emily has been doing these days, her dating life, and also find out if the social media star is pregnant!\r\n<h2>What Is Emily's Ears' Real Name And Age?<\/h2>\r\nBorn Emily Moore on 3rd December 2002, the social media icon is 19 years old. She will turn 20 in December of 2022. Born in the U.S., she has American nationality and belongs to mixed ethnicity. Moreover, her astrological sign is Sagittarius, and she follows Christianity.\r\n\r\nTalking about her education, she hasn't revealed her educational background. Considering her age, she must be in college.\r\n<h2>Emily's Ears' Family is Full of Social Media Stars<\/h2>\r\nThe social media influencer is the daughter of <strong>George Moore<\/strong> and <strong>Elisabeth Moore<\/strong>. Her mom is also quite famous on social media with 174k followers on Instagram, 18.2k on TikTok, and 4.92k subscribers on YouTube.\r\n\r\nUnlike her mother, their dad doesn't seem to be a big fan of cameras. His absence from all the social networks suggests Emily's father is not fond of social media. Despite the fact, her old man supports his kids and wife but has a minimum presence in their posts.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_958\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-958\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Emily-and-Family-1.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Ears and family\" width=\"450\" height=\"304\" \/> Emily's Ears with her brother Richboy Troy, sister Steph Thomas carrying her baby, and mother Elisabeth in between.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nLikewise, Moore's brother and sister are also social media influencers with relatively good numbers of followers.\r\n<h2>Who Are Emily's Ears' Siblings?<\/h2>\r\nEars' has a younger brother who is famous on social media by the name Richboy Troy. Born in 2006, he is a skit creator and an actor. Additionally, her brother is popular for his rap music.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, her elder sister Steph Thomas who was born in 1998 is also a YouTube star. She is a model and a YouTuber. She is popular for her prank videos and interviews. As of 2022, she has over 200k subscribers on her YouTube channel and 694k followers on Instagram.\r\n\r\nBesides, Emily also has another sister Zahara who is not as famous as her other siblings. Yet, she has 31.7k followers on Instagram.\r\n<h2>Emily Moore Is Currently Dating Her Boyfriend Kadin Oneekgg<\/h2>\r\nThe love relationship between Emily's Ears and her boyfriend Kadin Oneekgg is quite open on social media. Though many of the tabloids reported the couple broken up, it just seems to be some made-up baseless rumors. The duo is still together and having a great time. The romantic lovers also own a combined YouTube channel.\r\n\r\nMoving back to their love story, they started dating in 2019. Emily shared an intimate couple photo on Instagram on July 18, 2021 writing, \"2 years down, forever to go...\"\r\n\r\nThen again on November 16, 2021, she made a beautiful post where she wrote, \"You will always be my heart and soulmate\ud83d\udc8b #happyanniversary baby\ud83d\udc45.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_1164\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"wp-image-1164 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Emily-Ears-boyfriend-1.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Ears boyfriend Kadin Oneekgg\" width=\"450\" height=\"581\" \/> Emily and Kadin Oneekgg are dating since 2019.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nLike her, Emily's boyfriend also owns an Insta account with the name \"oneekgg\" and has 462k followers. As he writes \"Loyalty Over Anything,\" on his Insta bio, maybe he will never cheat or leave his girlfriend.\r\n\r\nThe now and then posted pictures and videos of the lovebirds show how deeply they are in love. We can see their relationship is only growing stronger and the pair are enjoying their love life to the fullest.\r\n<h2>Is Emily Ears Pregnant?<\/h2>\r\nEven though Emily has just crossed her teenagehood, she is soon going to be a mom. Yes, you heard it right. Emily is pregnant!!! She has said quite a lot of times on her social media that she is having a baby.\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 540px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-captioned=\"\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Cb1OMwNM-83\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\">\r\n<div style=\"padding: 16px;\">\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"><\/div>\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"><\/div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"><\/div>\r\n<div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"><\/div>\r\n<div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\">\r\n<div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"><\/div>\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;\">\r\n<div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);\"><\/div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;\"><\/div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);\"><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"><\/div>\r\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg);\"><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-left: auto;\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);\"><\/div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);\"><\/div>\r\n<div style=\"width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);\"><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"><\/div>\r\n<div style=\"background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"><\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Cb1OMwNM-83\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A post shared by MAIN PAGE\ud83d\udc9e (@emilys_ears)<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<\/div><\/blockquote>\r\n<script async src=\"\/\/www.instagram.com\/embed.js\"><\/script>\r\n\r\nEven so, it is still blurry if the news is true as the couple often makes prank videos. Emily along with her boyfriend has fooled their viewers so many times with such pranks so, it is hard to believe them until we find some solid proof.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we wish them good luck if they are having a baby and if not, we hope they will have one soon.\r\n<h2>Who is Emily Ears' Ex-Boyfriend?<\/h2>\r\nBefore Kadin, Emily was dating a guy named Adrian aka Smurftz. The former couple dated for a couple of years until 2019. Her ex-partner was also hearing impaired.\r\n\r\nThough they are no more together now, the ex-couple started their social media career together. In fact, they had a YouTube channel \"Adrian and Emily\" in 2018.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_959\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-959\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.test\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/Emily-and-Adrian-1.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Moore with her ex-boyfriend Adrian\" width=\"450\" height=\"247\" \/> Emily's Ears alongside her ex-boyfriend Adrian[\/caption]\r\n\r\nHowever, their relationship couldn't long last and they broke up after some time of dating. The duo even deleted their YouTube channel later.\r\n<h2>Emily Ears' Is On Instagram, TikTok, And YouTube<\/h2>\r\nBeing a social media star, Emily is highly active on all social media sites.
